# Welcome to My New Docusaurus-Powered Website

After years of running my personal site on WordPress, I've made the switch to Docusaurus and moved to a new domain: **md.finnious.com**. Here's why I made the change, what's different, and what you can expect going forward.

<!--truncate-->

## Why the Switch?

### From WordPress to Docusaurus

**WordPress served me well for years**, but I found myself wanting something different:

- **Faster performance** - Static sites load incredibly quickly
- **Better developer experience** - Writing in Markdown feels natural
- **Lower maintenance** - No database, no security updates, no plugin conflicts
- **Version control** - My entire site lives in GitHub with full history
- **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages costs nothing and scales automatically

### The Technology Stack

My new setup is beautifully simple:
- **Docusaurus** for the site framework
- **GitHub** for version control and content management  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Markdown** for all content
- **React** for any custom components I need

Total monthly cost: **$0** (just my domain registration)

## What's New

### Simplified Structure

Instead of dozens of category pages and granular posts, I've organized everything around key themes:

- **[Journey of Hope](/journey-of-hope)** - My cross-country cycling story
- **[Coffee Talk](/coffee)** - Because good coffee deserves its own page
- **[Health & Fitness](/health)** - My transformation story and ongoing journey
- **[Blog](/blog)** - Focused, high-quality posts on topics that matter
- **[Now](/now)** - What I'm currently working on and thinking about

### Better Content Organization

I've consolidated years of blog posts into focused, evergreen content. Instead of daily workout logs, you'll find comprehensive stories about my health journey. Instead of scattered thoughts, you'll find thoughtful posts that dive deep into topics.

### Enhanced Performance  

The site now loads instantly, works perfectly on mobile, and includes:
- Dark mode support
- Optimized images
- Clean typography
- Responsive design
- Fast search functionality

## Content Migration Philosophy

### What I Kept
- **High-value personal stories** (Journey of Hope, health transformation)
- **Thoughtful insights** on business, technology, and life
- **Actionable advice** that has stood the test of time
- **Book recommendations** and learning resources

### What I Consolidated
- Multiple workout posts → Single health journey story
- Scattered coffee thoughts → Dedicated coffee page  
- Various life updates → Organized blog posts and "Now" page

### What I Left Behind
- Daily workout logs (too granular for most readers)
- Time-sensitive content that's no longer relevant
- Duplicate or similar posts
- Content that didn't align with my current focus

## The Development Process

Building this site was a fun technical project:

1. **Analyzed my existing WordPress content** to identify the best material
2. **Designed a new information architecture** focused on user experience
3. **Set up Docusaurus** with custom styling and components
4. **Migrated and improved content** with better organization and writing
5. **Configured GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment
6. **Set up custom domain** and optimized for performance

The entire process taught me a lot about modern web development and reminded me why I enjoy building things.

## What to Expect Going Forward

### More Focused Content

Instead of posting frequently about everything, I'll write less often but with more depth:

- **Personal stories** that illustrate larger principles
- **Business insights** from running Creating Value LLC
- **Technology perspectives** especially around Web3 and AI
- **Health and fitness updates** from my ongoing journey
- **Book recommendations** and learning resources

### Better Engagement

The new format encourages:
- **Deeper reading** with longer, more thoughtful posts
- **Better organization** so you can find relevant content easily  
- **Cleaner sharing** with optimized social media integration
- **Faster loading** so you spend time reading, not waiting

### Continued Evolution

This site will grow and improve over time:
- New content sections as my interests evolve
- Enhanced features and functionality
- Better organization based on reader feedback
- Integration with other tools and platforms
