## The Challenge

This Summer, I rode a bicycle coast to coast over 4,000 miles from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, D.C. raising funds and awareness on behalf of people with disabilities. But just 9 months before the ride, I was physically unable to do this.

In order to make this dream possible, I had to go on a life-changing transformation. **In just 9 months, I dropped over 70 pounds, going from 268 to 198 on the scale.** The decision to make no more excuses gave me the determination to change my habits and diet to lose the necessary weight.

## The Training

I worked out at the Kroc Center and attended spin classes at Victory Bike Studio. I took advantage of the Greenline and the recently added bike lanes in Memphis to prepare for my journey across the country. Joining the group rides organized by the Memphis Hightailers bicycle club helped tremendously.

> "Scott joined our spin class with very basic knowledge of bicycling. Throughout the past several months, Scott has been in our bi-weekly classes and digging deep. He's gone from 1hr classes with just 15min of accumulative time spent in aerobic zones North of 70% of his Max, to here recently completing a class that boasted double that! 30min of a 1hr class accumulative was spent between 72-85% of his maximum output. This is huge growth!!"

## The Mission: Journey of Hope

From June 6th to August 12th, I rode over 75 miles per day, on average, as part of the 3 month Journey of Hope. I took the TransAmerica route, and met on the steps of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. with 30 other Pi Kappa Phi brothers.

**The Journey of Hope is a philanthropy mission created by my fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi that raises over $500,000 for people with disabilities annually.**

The bike ride is an example of service beyond self. The Journey of Hope serves the fraternity, to serve people with disabilities, and spread hope across the nation. 

> "My father's continued involvement in the fraternity has inspired me to ride the Journey of Hope. He showed me that the fraternity experience doesn't end after college."

## About The Journey of Hope

In 1987, one man's dream of riding his bike across the country came true. The very next year, his ride inspired The Ability Experience to create the largest fraternal fundraising and awareness event of its kind, the Journey of Hope. 

Today the Journey of Hope covers 32 different states, cycling over 12,000 miles combined, continuing to spread a message of acceptance and understanding for people with disabilities. From the inaugural team of 21 team members raising $20,000, the team has since been expanded into three different routes of 35 Pi Kappa Phis and annually raises more than $500,000 for people with disabilities.

## The Impact

This experience changed my life in countless ways:

- **Mental Resilience:** Learned to push through physical and mental barriers daily
- **Community Service:** Raised awareness and funds for people with disabilities
- **Brotherhood:** Strengthened lifelong bonds with my Pi Kappa Phi brothers
- **Personal Growth:** Discovered inner strength I never knew I had

## Reflections

> "Scott Finney's dedication to training for his transcontinental bike ride has been impressive to witness. The transformation of Scott combined with the cause of The Ability Experience is something that is very easy to support."

> **Christopher A. Whitestone DDS**, 4th Avenue Family Dentistry Denver, Colorado

The Journey of Hope taught me that the biggest barriers we face are often the ones we create in our own minds. When we commit to something greater than ourselves, we find strength we never knew we had.

This ride remains one of the defining experiences of my life, and the lessons learned continue to guide me in new challenges and adventures.
