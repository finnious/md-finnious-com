## My Coffee Journey

I've always enjoyed coffee, but would never splurge on a cup of quality coffee till a couple years ago. That's right, **I was one of those K-cup drinkers. Those were dark times.**

Intermittent fasting led me to drink coffee every day. Now a cup or two of coffee is part of my morning ritual. A little over a year ago I joined a coffee bean subscription service that I LOVE.

## My Current Setup

- **Manual burr grinder** for consistent grind size
- **French press** for home brewing
- **AeroPress** for travel (I never leave home without it!)

The ritual of grinding fresh beans and carefully brewing each cup has become a meditative part of my morning routine.

## Why Ethiopian Beans?

**Ethiopian Beans are my favorite.** Have you noticed Ethiopian beans have so much more flavor than South American beans? There's a reason for that...

Ethiopia is considered the birthplace of coffee, and their heirloom varieties have incredible complexity and unique flavor profiles that you just can't find anywhere else. The terroir, processing methods, and centuries of coffee cultivation create beans with bright acidity, floral notes, and wine-like characteristics.

## Coffee Questions for You

I'd love to hear your coffee story! Here are some questions I'm curious about:

- **Do you have a favorite bean origin?** What draws you to it?
- **What's the story of how you woke up one day and realized life is too short to be drinking K-cups?** (By the way, K-cups are just instant coffee in a plastic cup!)
- **What are you adding to your coffee?** Cream? Sugar? Something more adventurous?
- **Have you tried butter coffee yet?** It sounds weird but it's actually amazing for sustained energy

## The Great Coffee Conversation

Tell me about your coffee setup. Do you have a ritual around your morning brew? Are you a pour-over perfectionist or a "just give me caffeine" type of person?

One day I'll have a podcast on this topic. Drop me a comment or message and maybe you can be a guest on this future podcast. We can start the conversation on the topic of coffee, then see where it goes from there.

## Pro Tips

### Heat Your Vessel
Always warm your cup or mug before brewing. It makes a difference!

### Water Temperature Matters
Don't use boiling water - let it cool for 30 seconds after boiling, or aim for 195-205°F.

### Grind Fresh
The difference between pre-ground and fresh-ground beans is night and day.

### Ratios
I typically use a 1:15 ratio (coffee to water) but experiment to find what you like.
